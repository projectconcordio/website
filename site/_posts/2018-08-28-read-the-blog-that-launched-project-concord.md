# Meet Project Concord: An Open Source Decentralized Trust Infrastructure

After more than two years of internal development, we are excited to introduce Project Concord—an open source distributed trust infrastructure. We are thrilled to join the robust and thriving open source blockchain community and together deepen and broaden a shared blockchain vision focused on true trust decentralization.

## Centralized vs. Decentralized Trust Paradigms

Blockchain addresses challenges presented by centralized trust paradigms. In a centralized trust environment, one entity or agent acts as a single point of validation or control. This agent introduces friction (additional cost or time) into transactions and becomes a potential bottleneck or single point of failure and security attack point. A decentralized trust infrastructure eliminates that central authority by “virtualizing” trust and distributing it to participating entities (nodes). A blockchain that relies on decentralized trust infrastructure is typically a permissioned blockchain—one in which known entities (agents or nodes) are invited to participate.

The blockchain forms an unbroken, sequential “ledger” that’s replicated and stored on multiple, independent computers (nodes). Each node follows identical instructions (protocols) that dictate how to update the shared ledger with new transactions and how to determine whether those updates are valid. Many blockchains rely on resource-intensive “proof of work/proof of stake” to validate transactions. In decentralized trust-based infrastructures, consensus protocols validate transactions.
