<p>Concord is open source consensus engine, used in distributed systems such as Blockchain, to ensure that only valid data is entered into the Blockchain. The core engine of Project Concord is concord-bft, a generic state machine replication library that can handle malicious (byzantine) replicas.</p>

<p>This library is designed to be used as a core building block for replicated distributed data stores, and is especially suited to serve as the basis of permissioned Blockchain systems. Its implementation is based on the algorithm described in the paperÂ <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01626.pdf" target="_blank">SBFT: a Scalable Decentralized Trust Infrastructure for Blockchains.</a></p>

<p>Please join open source blockchain <a href="/community">community</a> and together deepen and broaden a shared blockchain vision focused on true trust decentralization.</p>
